        <strong>Helping Law Enforcement Agencies is great!</strong> We get requests via XML which is pretty cool.

<ul>
<li>CCS automates the provisioning of surveillance and record requests from a given Agency. The CCS process flow consists of Agency requests, submitted via XML, to analysts for Subpoena / Court Order document review, transcription and case submission. The CCS GUI is run by a Java Web Start application that uses internal AT&T Research technology (Yoix, an ancestor of Java) that invokes query exectuables via Perl scripts.</li>
<li>Led the client-side development of a CCS release. Worked closely with project management, technical team lead and clients to architect business requirements and engineer a process work flow. Worked against an aggressive schedule and was awarded 2 .Vice President Excellence. Awards as a team and a .Can-Do. Excellence Award as an individual contributor for drastically improving initial case load time for the analyst</li>
<li>Led the development and deployment of a subsequent CCS release. This deployment included a completely new technology base (from a Java Web Start framework to a purely web-based solution using HTML and PHP) and re-designed database schema. Led weekly status meetings with developers to discuss current requirement gaps and technical hurdles. Trained new developers and testers. Presented new interface and functionality to end users in the National Compliance Center (NCC) via technical demos. Was awarded a .Can-Do. Excellence Award for strong leadership skills that helped to resolve complex issues that blocked deployment.</li>

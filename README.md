To run project 4, simplye visit the index.html of the root directory. The pizza web page can be found in the bottom-most hyperlink (accompanied by the Pokeball picture). The optimizations made in main.js for pizza.html are:

1.) Hard-coded the pizza sizes. I found that the calculations aren't necessary since you get the same size every time. I logged the calculated sizes and then hard coded them in the "sizes" object literal (292.5px for small, 389.961px for medium and 585px for large).
2.) Reduced the number of elements created for the sliding pizzas in the background. Instead of iterating 200 times and creating 200 different elements, I iterate 15 times instead. This improves the fps and the effect is the same (as well as number of pizzas!).
3.) Compressed pizza.png to pizza_compressed.png. Reduced the size by 60% (30 KB total) via tinypng.com.

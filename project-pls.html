<ul>
<li>PLS allows state child support services to request information about .delinquent. parents. Led technical discussions with various state agencies to integrate their systems onto PLS. Worked against aggressive schedule and continually met milestones and deliverables. Coordinated activities among state clients, AT&T Subpoena Center, production support and firewall team to on-board 4 new state agencies</li>
<li> Re-design of PLS front-end technology base and overall process flow. Changed interface from outdated Java applet technology into HTML, JavaScript, jQuery and CSS for drastically improved functionality. Tweaked process flow by changing input file format from the state child support agency from fixed-width into XML with XSD validation. After designing new architecture, was able to mentor summer intern into completing tasks assigned to him for the redesign effort. </li>
